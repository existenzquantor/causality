## Installation

Make sure SWI Prolog is installed on your machine. Start a terminal and write _swipl_. If the command successfully starts the Prolog shell, everything is fine. SWI Prolog is available in common Linux package repositories, and Mac users can easily install it via brew. 

Then clone or download this github repository. That's it.
