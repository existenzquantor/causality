# causality

## Installation

Make sure SWI Prolog is installed on your machine. Start a terminal and write _swipl_. If the command successfully starts the Prolog shell, everything is fine. SWI Prolog is available in common Linux package repositories, and Mac users can easily install it via brew. 

Then clone or download this github repository. Make sure the file _causality_ is executable, viz., run _chmod +x causality_. That's it.

## Using the program

Example call: 
<code>
./causality "./examples/ex_butfor.pl" "a:a" "a" "not(p)" "but_for"
</code>

More explanation soon to come.
