## Installation

Make sure SWI Prolog is installed on your machine. Start a terminal and write "swipl". If the command successfully starts the Prolog Shell, everything is fine. SWI Prolog is available in common Linux package repositories, and Mac users can install it via brew. 

Then checkout this github repository. That's it.
